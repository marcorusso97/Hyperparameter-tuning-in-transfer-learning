# Hyperparameter-tuning-in-transfer-learning

Paper and Colab notebook related to my project "Hyperparameter tuning methods in Transfer Learning with application to
fine-grained classification" for a university course (MSc, 2nd year, 2021).
In this project I proposed a hyperparameter tuning method for Transfer Learning performing fine-grained classification on the Stanford Dogs dataset, comparing the accuracies among many CNN architectures.

I used Python, Keras and Scikit-learn.
